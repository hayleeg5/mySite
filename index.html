 <p style="background-color:gray;">I love basketball. My favorite college is Duke Univeristy which is also my favorite college basketball team. My favrite professional team is the Los Angeles Lakers. I grew up watching my basketball with my dad and it has become a passion for me.</p>
 <p style="background-color:gray;"> My favorite basketball player is Kobe Bryant. He became an inspiration to me on what a true team player and individual player should like look. Another one of my favorite players is rookie Zion Williamson who was drafted number one out of Duke University and onto the New Orleans Pelicans.
